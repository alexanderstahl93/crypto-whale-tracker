This repository contains a script that tracks large transfers of USDC tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses Ethers.js to interact with the blockchain and plays a sound notification whenever a large transfer occurs. The script provides a link to the transaction details on Etherscan for easy monitoring.
